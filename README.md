# Multiple-Disease-Prediction

This is a small project about a Multiple Disease Prediction system which predicts three diseases namely diabetes, parkinsons and heart disease.
Both parkinsons and diabetes predictor use SVM with linear kernel.
I used logistic regression to detect heart disease.
I have trained the models based on readily available datasets with a high accuracy score.  

The accuracy scores for the models are:  
1)Diabetes:77.27%
2)Heart Disease:81.96%
3)Parkinsons:87.17%  

The UI has been written using Streamlit library in python
